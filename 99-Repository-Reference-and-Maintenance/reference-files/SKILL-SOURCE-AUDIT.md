# External Skill Source, License, and Deduplication Audit

Use this ledger before importing, adapting, linking, replacing, or rejecting an external skill. It records decisions, not endorsements or rankings.

## Decision Rules

- **ADD** only when the capability is missing from the active skill map.
- **UPDATE** when a candidate supplies a stronger workflow pattern for an existing page.
- **LINK** when the implementation is useful but platform-specific, too broad, overlapping, or not licensed for copying.
- **DO NOT COPY** when the repository has no clear license; public visibility is not reuse permission.
- Compare semantics—trigger, inputs, procedure, outputs, risks, and verification—not only names.
- Inspect files, scripts, dependencies, permissions, network calls, secret handling, and install steps before execution.

## 2026-08-24 Audit

GitHub repository search and exact-file review were performed on 2026-08-24. Star counts and marketplace claims were treated only as discovery signals, never as quality evidence.

| Source | Maintainer / license at check | Distinct pattern found | Existing overlap | Decision and destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenAI “Build skills”](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) | OpenAI / official documentation | focused jobs, progressive disclosure, concise trigger descriptions, optional scripts/references/assets, trigger tests | repo already uses skill blocks but lacked an intake/eval gate | **UPDATE** `09` Skill 7 and review standards |
| [`AlterLab-Academic-Skills`](https://github.com/AlterLab-IEU/AlterLab-Academic-Skills) | AlterLab / MIT | survey design, design-object-first survey analysis, preregistration/deviation gates, meta-analysis, positive and near-miss evals | ordinary literature review and econometrics existed; these four workflows did not | **ADD** `19` and `20`; **UPDATE** `09` eval pattern |
| [`scientific-agent-skills`](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) | K-Dense Inc. / MIT | seeded experimental design, assignment/measurement boundaries, rival predictions, evidence ledgers, local deterministic validators | general research-question and literature skills existed; original-data design did not | **ADD/ADAPT** `19`; **LINK** scripts rather than copying domain-specific implementation |
| [`finai-research`](https://github.com/csmar432/finai-research) | CSMAR Data Center maintainers / MIT | data-source preflight, explicit fallback checkpoint, no silent simulated-data substitution, provenance log | `14` already had cleaning/merging but not acquisition governance | **UPDATE** `14` Skill 7; source-specific endpoints and credentials not copied |
| [`awesome-academic-skills`](https://github.com/O0000-code/awesome-academic-skills) | O0000-code / CC0-1.0 | research-lifecycle catalog with license and execution notes | resource database existed but lacked semantic dedup and trust gates | **UPDATE** `09` Skill 7 and this ledger |
| [`econometrics-skill`](https://github.com/xiaomihu1992/econometrics-skill) | xiaomihu1992 / MIT | estimator routing and applied code workflow | active `11`, `08`, and `14` already cover the same estimator families with stronger identification/verification boundaries | **LINK/NO ADD**; no duplicate estimator page |
| [`Awesome-Scientific-Skills`](https://github.com/InternScience/Awesome-Scientific-Skills) | InternScience / MIT | curated scientific-skill discovery | source index, not a unique economics workflow | **LINK/NO ADD**; useful for future discovery only |
| [`Auto-Empirical-Research-Skills`](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/Auto-Empirical-Research-Skills) | CoPaper.AI / GitHub API returned `NOASSERTION` | very large empirical-social-science catalog | broad overlap with nearly every active family | **DO NOT COPY** without license clarification; discovery-only |
| [`EconAgentSkills`](https://github.com/JonasWeinert/EconAgentSkills) | Jonas Weinert / GitHub API returned `NOASSERTION` | DIME-oriented econometric workflow packaging | overlaps `08`, `11`, and `14` | **DO NOT COPY** without license clarification; existing pages cite DIME directly |
| [`stata-skill`](https://github.com/dylantmoore/stata-skill) | Dylan Moore / GitHub API returned `NOASSERTION` | broad Stata syntax/package coverage | overlaps the Stata assistant in `08` | **DO NOT COPY** without license clarification; possible external link after manual testing |
| [`Awesome-Journal-Skills`](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/Awesome-Journal-Skills) | CoPaper.AI / MIT | journal-specific routing | overlaps writing, methods, referee, and disclosure skills; journal policies are time-sensitive | **TEST LATER**; do not add “fast track publication” claims without policy-by-policy verification |

## Accepted Change Map

| Active destination | What changed | Corresponding attribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/09-tool-selection-updates-and-skill-improvement.md` | external-skill provenance, semantic dedup, trust inspection, license gate, trigger/non-trigger evals | OpenAI, O0000-code, AlterLab, K-Dense |
| `skills/11-causal-inference-econometrics-and-time-series-skills.md` | real-time vintages, forecast origins, pseudo-out-of-sample evaluation, benchmarks, leakage | ALFRED, Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, K-Dense, AlterLab |
| `skills/14-data-cleaning-merging-analysis-and-output-skills.md` | acquisition preflight, explicit fallback checkpoint, immutable raw data, provenance record | `finai-research`, DIME, SEC/FRED official docs |
| `skills/19-survey-experiment-and-preregistration-skills.md` | new original-data study-design family | DIME, K-Dense, AlterLab, COS, EGAP, AEA RCT Registry |
| `skills/20-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-skills.md` | new systematic evidence-synthesis family | AlterLab, K-Dense, PRISMA, Cochrane, Campbell, Stanley & Doucouliagos |

## Next Audit Rule

For every future candidate, add one row here and add attribution in the exact skill page that changes. A central row without page-level attribution is incomplete; page-level attribution without a dedup decision is also incomplete.
